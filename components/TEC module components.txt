1. TEC 12706 

This is 12V, 3.5A, 42Watts. In just 3 seconds it gets freezing cold at cold side
and burning hot in the hot side.

When current is constant, for a variable voltage, the temperature can be controlled,
but the voltage range is so squeezed: Maybe, becomes hard to control when current is
constant and voltage varies. This can be seen in datasheet.

We can control the Peltier's Temp by varying power as well. Doing this we can harness
precise control: for our project, precise control of the Peltier is a must. The
characteristic is found in Datasheet.

2. Thermal paste
We should apply thermal paste in between TEC and heatsink in order to, physically,
keep them attached while still making heat transfer possible.

3. Heat Sink
We need heat sink to -- no need to mention!

4. Fan (much like CPU fan)
We need fan to -- again, no need to mention!
